Hey! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Marc :) I'm a software developer based in Spain.

I like Ruby, and I like functional programming. You can see me advocating for a functional approach to the language, taking advantage of its flexibility and expressiveness to write code that blends object-oriented and functional paradigms.

My mission in open source is to make that vision more mainstream. I'm currently helping to build the [Hanami framework](https://github.com/hanami) together with the [dry-rb](https://github.com/dry-rb) ecosystem, where this mindset is at its core. I'm also the author of [web_pipe](https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/web_pipe), a library that allows building rack applications than can compose.

In the future, you can expect me to try to leverage this idea to build something with a positive social impact, as I think that should be technology's primary goal. You could also see me building some tools for developers probably in purely functional programming languages like Elixir or Haskell.

I work at a great place, [Nebulab](https://nebulab.com/), helping to build [Solidus](https://solidus.io/), an open-source e-commerce platform for developers.

You can [sponsor my OS work](https://github.com/sponsors/waiting-for-dev) :heart: :heart:
